	* Tag: GNUPG_0_04

	* NEWS:		    Added a news file.

	* GnuPG/Tie.pm(new): Make sure that pipes aren't closed after an
			    exec and that they are unbuffered. Also use
			    CORE::Exit(0) instead of exit(0) so that the  
			    things works under mod_perl.
			    (version): Upgraded to version 0.04.

	* GnuPG.pm (new):   Specifying gnupg_path wasn't working properly.
			    When gpg isn't found in PATH print the content
			    of PATH in the error message.
			    (run_gnupg): /dev/null wasn't open for
			    writing. Use CORE::exit(1) so that the
			    function still works undef mod_perl.
