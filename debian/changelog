libgnupg-perl (0.9-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make/sh prefers "! [ -d foo ]" over "![ -d foo ]".  It didn't really
    matter because there was a "|| rmdir foo" after that and the directory
    existed, but it prints ugly warnings that I missed before.

libgnupg-perl (0.9-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends.
  * Apply patch by Andrew Suffield to handle key retrival by GnuPG caused by
    'keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve' (closes: #269627).  Thanks.
  * Apply patch by Andrew Suffield to properly propagte that reason
    for verification errors when the key is not around (closes: #310792).
    Thanks once more.
  * Instead of defining INSTALLBIN, INSTALLSCRIPT, etc just say
    INSTALLDIRS=vendor in debian/rules, and set PREFIX for the install.
  * Also use make install and not make pure_install.
  * Remove code to remove .packlist files from the install target.
  * Remove lots of comments (and unused, commented out lines) from
    debian/rules.
  * Remove usr/sbin from debian/dirs (debhelper).  We don't put anything
    there.
  * Remove empty usr/lib/perl5 and usr/lib after make install.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.2 from 3.6.1 (without additional changes).

libgnupg-perl (0.9-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * GnuPG::Perl looks to be quite unmaintained upstream, so I recomment
    people use other modules, like GnuPG::Interface maybe, however
    apply Adrian's patch for his POLICY_URL problem.  GnuPG.pm would
    complain about protocol violations when a signature had more
    information (like a POLICY_URL) than it expected (Closes: #316065).
  * Change from debhelper compat level 2 to 4, and change build depends
    accordingly.

libgnupg-perl (0.9-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * GnuPG 1.2.5 introduced a few more status lines when decrypting/verifying
    files.  GnuPG.pm would not handle that properly.  We now eat all the
    status lines in decrypt_postread() (closes: #298556).

libgnupg-perl (0.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install non binary perl into usr/share rather than usr/lib.
  * Slight changes to debian/copyright: replace "author(s)" with
    "author", refer to GPL-2 rather than GPL.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
  * Fix build dependency on debhelper: it needs to be versioned (>=2).
  * Don't end short desciprtion with a dot.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Apr 2004 15:27:54 +0200

libgnupg-perl (0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Standards-Version: 3.5.7
    - Have no /usr/doc link anymore (actually building against the new
      debhelper does fix this - I'll not depend on it tho to make
      building it on older releases easier)
    - Change Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep
