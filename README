perl
gpg 1.0.0 or later. (Version 1.05 recommanded)
SysV compatible shared memory.

Description
-----------

GnuPG is a perl module that interface with the Gnu Privacy Guard using
the coprocess hooks provided by gpg. The communication mechanism uses
is shared memory and a status file descriptor. 

There are others perl interface to PGP and GnuPG but none of them
used the coprocess interface  provided by gpg.

The module tries it best to map the rather interactive interface
of gpg to a more programmatic API.

Also the modules now offers a tied file handle interface to encryption
and decryption making a lot more easy to use.

Installing
----------

The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is included in POD format.

Limitations
-----------

This module doesn't yet provides an interface to the key manipulation
facilities of gpg. 

It doesn't also provides the memory protection offered by gpg when
manipulating user passphrase.

There are also several options (like cipher selections) that aren't
available from the perl API.
